# Advent Of Code

Based on the site [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) created by [Eric Wastl](https://github.com/topaz).

Which every december gives an advent calendar, allowing to have fun to solve puzzles.

I decided to solve these in **javascript** for the first, maybe I'll change to python or something else for the next puzzles.
